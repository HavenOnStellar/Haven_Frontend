# Contributing to Haven

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Haven! We're building the decentralized standard for device registries on Stellar, and every contribution matters.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# For contracts
git clone https://github.com/HavenOnStellar/Haven_Contracts.git

# For frontend
git clone https://github.com/HavenOnStellar/Haven_Frontend.git
```

### 2. Pick an Issue

- Browse open issues on [haven-contracts](https://github.com/HavenOnStellar/Haven_Contracts/issues) or [haven-frontend](https://github.com/HavenOnStellar/Haven_Frontend/issues)
- Look for labels: `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, `contracts`, `frontend`
- Comment on the issue to let us know you're working on it

### 3. Find `TODO` Markers

The codebase is intentionally full of `// TODO:` comments marking areas that need implementation. Run:

```bash
# Find all TODOs in contracts
grep -rn "TODO" contracts/

# Find all TODOs in frontend
grep -rn "TODO" frontend/src/
```

## 🌿 Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```
feature/bounty-escrow-logic
fix/device-state-validation
docs/update-readme
```

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Smart Contracts (Rust/Soroban)

```bash
cd contracts

# Check compilation
cargo check

# Run tests
cargo test

# Lint

cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Build WASM
stellar contract build
```

### Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

## 🎨 Code Style

### Rust
- Format with `cargo fmt`
- Lint with `cargo clippy`
- Use `#![no_std]` in all contract code
- Keep functions small and well-documented

### TypeScript / React
- ESLint config is provided in the project
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use TypeScript strict mode
